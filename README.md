This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component doesn't render correctly when data is fetched asynchronously using useEffect and setTimeout.  The bug occurs because the component may render before the data is available, resulting in a blank screen. The solution provides a clear fix using the loading state to display a message while fetching data.
